    content:
      - text: "We as humans have broadcasted for centuries. Absolutely revolutionary. Yet, we still hold on to antiquated technologies and methodologies in the modern world."
      - text: "While not a bad thing, it's time we utilized our new technologies in new ways, adopting new methodologies along the way. That is where we come in."
      - text: "Every step of the way in our broadcasting journey is careful examined to determine if it is the best use of our technologies, or if we can improve it in some way. Broadcasting doesn't have to be old-fashioned, we can reinvent it with new capabilities."

    heading: "Just in time for the modern age."

    content:
      - text: "Don't think that we're trying to get rid of older means of broadcasting -- that is most certainly not the case. Instead, we're expanding on it. Using new technologies to reach a more modern audience is how we've evolved with technology previously. So instead of reinventing anything, we're improving upon what is already here and available."

    heading: "Backed by robust infrastructure"
    content:
      - text: "What good is this new technology if you can't use it? Our fresh approach to the world of IT allows us to use already-existing infrastructure to better serve you, the customer, and keep us online even when everyone else isn't."
