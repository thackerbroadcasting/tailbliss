You must be wondering "why should I choose this little company over one of the bigger ones? They know what they're doing, they've been doing it for years!"

While you may be correct about them doing it for years, that is where their downfall lies. You see, traditional music playout systems like the one(s) you may be thinking of have been around for a long time and haven't seen much change. Typically, these system require them to come in and install bulky equipment, raising your electric bill and taking up precious space that you might could otherwise use to benefit you and your business.

These systems are tried and true. They do exactly what they are supposed to do, and they do it well. There's no denying that. However, because they've been around for a long time, they haven't had a chance to change with the ever changing landscape of public retail, office work, and even broadcast radio. It has become so saturated with ads that it is unbearable to listen to, it overplays music (usually in a set playlist), and it ultimately doesn't allow for customer interaction or customization. What you got is it.

This is where we do things a little differently. Our system does require some hardware to be located in your store somewhere, we're not denying that. However, our hardware is very small, low-power, and very light. In fact, you can put our hardware on top of a ceiling tile and you'd never have to worry about it again. We'll do the worrying.

In addition, our playout system sits in the cloud on robust hardware that works as hard as you do. Our system allows for customization, and lots of it! Want to play 80s for a couple hours at your restaurant? Done. How about a rotating theme throughout the day, jazz in the morning and rock in the evening? Easy. Change up your bar by allowing customers to make requests and actually hear them, for no additional fee! Turn off the music whenever you want for however long you want. Turn it on during certain times of the day. Have a karaoke night and let customers choose from your set list of songs. Dictate your OWN music playlist. Make it YOUR OWN! And the best part is, none of it costs any more than what you'll already be paying.

So why not change things up a bit? Grocery store music playing the latest hits is so overdone. Let your customers shop to whatever you want! Music genre, specific artists, time periods, whatever you can think of. Restaurant, bar, shopping mall, grocery store, broadcast radio, you name it -- we've got it covered. Your customers -- and employees -- will thank you.

Put control of your music system back into your own hands. No more iPad in the back playing that same playlist on shuffle. No more bulky playout system sitting in the back room. No more groaning at that new hit song everyone is sick of.

Slick. Streamlined. Easy to use. Manage from anywhere.
