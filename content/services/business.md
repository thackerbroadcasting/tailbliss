Enough is enough. You can't stand to hear "All I Want for Christmas Is You" another time. Or that pop song that just came out. Imagine being able to change the entire lineup – or remove one song – with a click.

Now make that imagination a reality.

Thacker Broadcasting can change your in-store, office space, or eatery music to fit your customer base and keep them coming back for more. More enjoyable to work with. More enjoyable to shop with. More enjoyable to dine with.

Want 80s at 8? How about alternative rock all the time? Pop in the mornings, R&B in the evenings? Perhaps a teen night every Friday night from 8-10? No music for that serious 7am meeting on Tuesdays? Rock for one floor, Jazz for another? New music Mondays, Repeat Fridays? Kathy wants Blues in the morning, Jeff wants Pop in the afternoon? Does Kala want to listen to a specific song? How about Nolan?

Whatever the situation or what you're listening to, we have you covered. From automatic music switching to a public request system, we've got the solution for you. [Contact us](../contact) to find more about how Thacker Broadcasting can give you something new to listen to every day. Or we'll keep serving up your favorites. It's your choice.

## In-Store
Christmas is approaching and… Mariah Carry is back at it, telling you all she wants for Christmas. Enough. Break the traditions and give your customers (and staff) something they want to listen to. Stop listening to the same tracks on repeat.

## Office Space
Your music probably blends nicely in the background of your office. Awesome. But is your staff constantly turning on their own? Perhaps you want to announce the volleyball game next month, but in a unique way. Get all of it changed easy-peasy to something your employees — and colleagues — want to listen to.

## Property
Mall management? Store or restaurant-chain owner? Whatever the situation, you manage (or own) lots of properties and you’re tired of listening to music you don’t enjoy. And if you don’t enjoy it, neither do your customers. Choose the music, any ads you want (or give us your own), and the schedule you want. Think of it as a personal radio station!

## Bar/Restaurant
Picture this: That one song keeps coming on. You know the one because everyone groans to themselves and says “again?”. Get rid of that song — and your current music solution — for something that will fit the ever-changing scenery of your restaurant or bar. Personalize how you want — including live requests — and we’ll take care of the rest.
